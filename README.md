# 2019 Adobe Summit Lab L779

## Overview
This repo contains the assets necessary for the Adobe Summit Lab L779 titled "Deploy Adobe Experience Cloud on a Website in 90 Minutes using Launch."

## Lab Objectives
Learn how to deploy Adobe Experience Cloud via Launch. We cover the principles at enough depth to empower you to tackle your own use cases when you get back to the office. To get the most out of this lab, you need a basic understanding of Launch features and functionality, which you can get by attending L780 â€“ Adobe Experience Platform Launch: Getting Started Lab.

You learn how to:

- Install Launch on a site and/or Use the Debugger to Simulate it
- Deploy ECID
- Deploy Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target
- Enable AAM server-side forwarding

## What Assets are in this Repo
Here you will find things like digital copies of the Lab Manual.  Those attending in person will also receive a print copy.
You will also find any scripts or code snippets that need to be used in the Lab.  That is just to make it easier to copy and paste, rather than to re-type everything.
